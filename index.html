	<h2>My commitments 📖 </h2>
	<p>For me, community life is very important. I was a member of the Red Cross. I have done tutoring missions helping disadvantaged children with their homework. I have also been a volunteer in a retirement home. Protecting the planet is very important to me. Apart from the "Friday a for futur" climate demonstrations I regularly participate in the Word Clean Up Day.</p>

	<h2>My trips✈️ </h2>
	<p>Since I was a baby I have had the chance to travel a lot. I took my first steps on the beach in the Seychelles. I went three times to Cuba where I discovered a totally different culture. I think it was in Cuba that my commitment to the community was born. I shared a week with a little Cuban girl, she lived in a small fishing village and had almost nothing. It is this trip that has been the most significant for me </p>

	<h2>My spirituality 🔮</h2>
	<p>Since I was a child, my mother and grandmother have initiated me spiritually. I learned to read and make a star chart with my grandmother. My mother taught me the tarot. Another divinatory art that was not taught to me was the art of the pendulum. The next step is spiritualism. </p>
